This helper plugin could be used for displaying time difference in hrs.mins format.
Also the plugin makes available a method which displays the current financial week.

some view file (index.html.erb):

<%= custom_distance_of_time(Time.now - 2.days, Time.now )%>
would display 48.00 hrs.


Current Financial Week : <%= current_financial_week %>
would display the current financial week number (year starts in April)
